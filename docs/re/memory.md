# Memory

Where the running game keeps the state the client needs. Addresses are module-relative
(`Zexion.exe+offset`) and good for build B1 only; they become byte patterns before any client
code relies on them (see `/find-address`). Format per `docs/re/README.md`.

## Save data lives in Zexion.exe's static data

| Field | |
|---|---|
| Value | The save state is in the module image (writable static data), not the heap, so its offsets from the module base are fixed for a build:<br>• One block per save slot, in an array: slot N's first save block is at `Zexion.exe+0x230600 + (N−1) × 0x9408`. Each matches the first block of `Save Game N.sav` (file offsets `0x0002` to `0x9409`) byte for byte; checked for slots 1, 2, 3, 28, 29 and 30.<br>• The loaded randomizer save's appended section (file `0x12812` onward, without its `E8 03` header) is mirrored from `Zexion.exe+0x357E18` (location cells), with the item table at `+0x358084` and the seed at `+0x358120`.<br>• The seed also appears at `+0x356F10` and `+0xCDD9D8`. Other near-copies of slot 30's block are at `+0xDDAC58` (37,845 of 37,896 bytes equal; file offset `0x129` = 1) and `+0xDED468` (37,881 equal; `0x129` = 0). One of these may be the live play state; not yet shown. |
| Status | measured |
| Method | memory scan with `tools/memscan.py` (search for the seed and the all-Scrap table, then whole-block comparison against backup copies of the saves) |
| Build | B1 |
| Evidence | 2026-10-20, slot 30 loaded. Saves compared from `lab/backups/20261020-213828/` and `lab/backups/20261020-213055/`. None of the copies changed over a 3-second window, with the game possibly paused. |
